# AI in Medicine and Life Sciences – AI for image and video data 

## Teachers
Sonja Aits (course coordinator), Faculty of Medicine, Lund University

Marcus Klang, LTH, Lund University

## Course description
AI is a rapidly evolving technology that will be widely used in medical and life science research as well as clinical care. The aim of the course is to enable students to apply AI models in the analysis of images and videos and provide them with a deeper understanding of opportunities and challenges for using this technology in medicine and life science. This will enable students to work with AI in various ways in their PhD studies or later careers.
The course is given as a 1.5 ECTS block course that can be extended with a 4.5 ECTS individual project.

## Learning outcomes
On passing of the course, the course participants shall be able to:

### Knowledge and understanding

•	Describe key concepts of AI-based image/video analysis in detail

•	Exemplify uses for AI-based image/video analysis in medicine and life sciences

•	Describe the process of training an AI model in detail

### Competences and Skills

•	Identify problems which can be solved using AI-based image/video analysis, and conceive a suitable research strategy for such an AI research project

•	Train AI models for image/video analysis tasks using suitable programming packages

### Judgement and approach

•	Identify and discuss specific opportunities as well as ethical, societal and legal issues related to the application of AI-based image/video analysis in medicine and life sciences

•	Evaluate the suitability of AI-based approaches for specific image/video analysis tasks

## Entry requirements
Students have to have a basic understanding of AI concepts, e.g. from attending the course “Artificial Intelligence in Medicine and Life Science – Introduction (NTF014F)” or self studies, and basic programming skills in python.
