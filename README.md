# AI in Medicine and Life Sciences – AI for image and video data 

## Teachers
[Sonja Aits](https://github.com/SonjaAits), Faculty of Medicine, Lund University (course coordinator)

[Marcus Klang](https://github.com/marcusklang), LTH, Lund University

## Course description
AI is a rapidly evolving technology that will be widely used in medical and life science research as well as clinical care. The aim of the course is to enable students to apply AI models in the analysis of images and videos and provide them with a deeper understanding of opportunities and challenges for using this technology in medicine and life science. This will enable students to work with AI in various ways in their PhD studies or later careers.
The course is given as a 1.5 ECTS block course that can be extended with an individual project to receive a total of 6 ECTS. It is not possible to receive credits for the project alone.

## Learning outcomes
On passing of the course, the course participants shall be able to:

### Knowledge and understanding

•	Describe key concepts of AI-based image/video analysis in detail

•	Exemplify uses for AI-based image/video analysis in medicine and life sciences

•	Describe the process of training an AI model in detail

### Competences and Skills

•	Identify problems which can be solved using AI-based image/video analysis, and conceive a suitable research strategy for such an AI research project

•	Train AI models for image/video analysis tasks using suitable programming packages

### Judgement and approach

•	Identify and discuss specific opportunities as well as ethical, societal and legal issues related to the application of AI-based image/video analysis in medicine and life sciences

•	Evaluate the suitability of AI-based approaches for specific image/video analysis tasks

## Entry requirements
Students have to have a basic understanding of AI concepts, e.g. from attending the course “Artificial Intelligence in Medicine and Life Science – Introduction (NTF014F)” or self studies, and basic programming skills in python.

## Attendance
It is not mandatory to attend all parts of the course to receive a pass grade as the course material will be shared and can be studied independently. However, if you are going to miss more than half a day, please get in contact with the course leader. Attendance at the examination is mandatory but if needed, an alternative examination date can be set up.

## Examination
Grades are pass/fail. All assignments are to be created using the templates in the ["templates"](https://github.com/COMPUTE-LU/AI4MedLife_imaging_2021/tree/main/templates) folder on this page. Completed assignments need to be uploaded to LU box folders. You will receive the links to these LU box folders after the start of the course via email.

For project 1 and 2, you are expected to read at least one research article related to your projects. Suitable articles can for example be found on:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/

https://www.biorxiv.org/

https://arxiv.org/

### To receive 1.5 ECTS:

•	Complete project 1, which consist of developing a concept for a small computer vision research project. The project is to be presented in an oral presentation on Oct 28 (also upload the presentation to LU box).

•	Submit a written review with suggestions for improvements for project 1 of two other students (the projects for reviewing will be assigned to you). Deadline Nov 1 (upload to LU box).

### To receive 6 ECTS:

•	Submit a written review with suggestions for improvements for project 1 of two other students (the projects for reviewing will be assigned to you). Deadline Nov 1 (upload to LU box).

•	Complete project 2, in which you execute all or part of your project 1, including training and evaluating at least two models. The project is to be summarized in a written report (deadline Nov 14) and presented in an oral presentation on Nov 17 (also upload the presentation to LU box).

•	Submit a written review with suggestions for improvements for the project 2 of one other student (this will be assigned to you). Deadline Nov 24 (upload to LU box).

Detailed instructions will be given in the course.
