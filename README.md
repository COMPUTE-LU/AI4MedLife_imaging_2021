# AI in Medicine and Life Sciences – AI for image and video data 

## Teachers
[Sonja Aits](https://github.com/SonjaAits), Faculty of Medicine, Lund University (course coordinator)

[Marcus Klang](https://github.com/marcusklang), LTH, Lund University

## Course description
AI is a rapidly evolving technology that will be widely used in medical and life science research as well as clinical care. The aim of the course is to enable students to apply AI models in the analysis of images and videos and provide them with a deeper understanding of opportunities and challenges for using this technology in medicine and life science. This will enable students to work with AI in various ways in their PhD studies or later careers.
The course is given as a 1.5 ECTS block course that can be extended with an individual project to receive a total of 6 ECTS. It is not possible to receive credits for the project alone.

## Learning outcomes
On passing of the course, the course participants shall be able to:

### Knowledge and understanding

•	Describe key concepts of AI-based image/video analysis in detail

•	Exemplify uses for AI-based image/video analysis in medicine and life sciences

•	Describe the process of training an AI model in detail

### Competences and Skills

•	Identify problems which can be solved using AI-based image/video analysis, and conceive a suitable research strategy for such an AI research project

•	Train AI models for image/video analysis tasks using suitable programming packages

### Judgement and approach

•	Identify and discuss specific opportunities as well as ethical, societal and legal issues related to the application of AI-based image/video analysis in medicine and life sciences

•	Evaluate the suitability of AI-based approaches for specific image/video analysis tasks

## Entry requirements
Students have to have a basic understanding of AI concepts, e.g. from attending the course “Artificial Intelligence in Medicine and Life Science – Introduction (NTF014F)” or self studies, and basic programming skills in python.

## Journal club
Read the paper before journal club on Oct 26:

Lugagne 2020, DeLTA: Automated cell segmentation, tracking, and lineage reconstruction using deep learning

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7153852/

At the journal club:

Discussion of [journal club questions](https://github.com/COMPUTE-LU/AI4MedLife_imaging_2021/blob/main/journalclub.txt) 40 min in breakout rooms

Discussion main points 20 min in full group


## Attendance
It is not mandatory to attend all parts of the course to receive a pass grade as the course material will be shared and can be studied independently. However, if you are going to miss more than half a day, please get in contact with the course leader. Attendance at the examination is mandatory but if needed, an alternative examination date can be set up.

## Examination
Grades are pass/fail. All assignments are to be created using the templates in the ["templates"](https://github.com/COMPUTE-LU/AI4MedLife_imaging_2021/tree/main/templates) folder on this page. Completed assignments need to be uploaded to LU box folders. You will receive the links to these LU box folders after the start of the course via email.

You are encouraged to discuss the course materials and your project ideas with your classmates and explore and even partially re-use publicly available code. However, all work you submit must be your own at least in part, re-used code must be clearly labelled. Shared projects or re-submission of prior course or research work you have created yourself is not allowed.

This is encouraged:

- Getting feedback on project ideas from fellow course members, friends or colleagues
- Discussing general approaches to solving computer vision tasks with others
- Looking at reserach articles, tutorials or github repos to understand how others have approached similar tasks
- Re-using some code, e.g. from articles, tutorials or github repos (but with clear source attribution!)
- Re-using graphical elements (e.g. diagrams, cartoons) you or others have created in other contexts for the introduction part of your presentation


This is is not allowed and constitutes plagiarism:

- Submitting the same or highly similar presentation, report, review or code as another course member. A mere change of the research question is not sufficiently different either if the project strategy is otherwise identical.
- Copying all or almost all code, presentation content or report content from other sources or from one of your previous courses, thesis works or research projects
- Re-using code written by others without clear source attribution for each line of copied code
- Copying text sections for your report or slides for your presentation from other sources

Basically, follow common sense and sound scientific and educational practice. If in doubt, please ask!
  
 

For project 1 and 2, you are expected to read at least one research article related to your projects. Suitable articles can for example be found on:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/

https://www.biorxiv.org/

https://arxiv.org/
